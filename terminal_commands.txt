Below are some terminal commands that you may find yourself using in class this semester:


pwd: "print working directory"
cd: "change directory"
TAB: autocompletes what you're typing, if there is an unambiguous file/folder by that name in your current directory.
ls: list information about files
pip: stands for "preferred installer program".  Used for installing new packages through terminal (e.g., pip install virtualenv)
rm: USE WITH CAUTION. This will delete a file/directory.
help: issued after a terminal command to see its documentation
clear: clears the terminal to a clean slate
